# Generate Valid Angle Bracket Sequences

**Note:** I found this problem too difficult to solve on my own.

Given n, return all valid sequences of n pairs of '<' and '>' with proper nesting.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
n = 1
```

**Output:**

```
<>
```

**Explanation:**

With one pair of angle brackets, the only valid nesting is `"< >"`.  
The function starts with an empty string and can only place a '<' then a '>' yielding `"<>"`.

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
n = 2
```

**Output:**

```
<><>
<<>>
```

**Explanation:**

There are two valid sequences for two pairs:  
`"<><>"` — place the two pairs side by side.  
`"<<>>"` — nest the second pair inside the first.  
The backtracking builds these by adding '<' when we have not yet placed 2, and '>' when there is an unmatched '<'.

### Example 3

**Input:**

```
n = 3
```

**Output:**

```
<<<>>>
<<><>>
<<>><>
<><<>>
<><><>
```

**Explanation:**

For three pairs, there are 5 valid sequences (analogous to balanced parentheses):

- `"((()))"` → `"<<<>>>"`
- `"(()())"` → `"<<><>>"`
- `"(())()"` → `"<<>><>"`
- `"()(())"` → `"<><<>>"`
- `"()()()"` → `"<><><>"`

Each sequence is generated by choosing to place '<' when remaining > 0, and '>' when there is at least one unmatched '<'.

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, n, representing the number of pairs.

## Constraints

- `0 <= n <= 12`
- n is an integer

## Output Format

Return a STRING_ARRAY containing every valid sequence of 2·n characters where the brackets are properly nested.

## Sample Input 0

```
1
```

## Sample Output 0

```
<>
```

## Sample Input 1

```
2
```

## Sample Output 1

```
<<>>
<><>
```

## How to Run

To run the solution using Node.js with input from stdin:

```bash
printf "2" | node index.js
```

Replace `2` with your desired number of pairs.
